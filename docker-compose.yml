#
# Docker Compose file for MijnOpenstad
#
# Extra notes:
# - You can run MijnOpenstad by running `docker-compose up -d`.
# This will create the MySQL Database and web server.
#
# Afterwards migrate the database by running the following commands:
# - `docker-compose exec web knex migrate:latest --env production`
# - `docker-compose exec web knex seed:run --env production`
#
